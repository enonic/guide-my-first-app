= My first app

A step-by-step guide to building your first application on the Enonic platform

== Installing the software development environment

In order to complete this guide, you need to have the Enonic development environment installed on your computer.
TODO

== Setting up your project

Lets create a project structure for your application. To be efficient, we will use an script to initialize our project from a template:

. Go to the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/vanilla-starter[Vanilla Starter kit] on Enonic Market
. Click the image:images/clone.png[Clone, 100] button
. Follow the instructions run the init-project command

Once the script is completed, you will have generated a project folder, with a structure looking something like this:

TODO






[NOTE]
====
The following folders and files generated in the project will not be used in this tutorial, and you may optionally remove them:

  src/main/resources/site*
  src/main/resources/admin*

====

== Building and Deploying

Now that we have an application project, its time to build and deploy the app to the development environment.

Verify XP_HOME
gradlew deploy
TODO::

Once the task is completed, we can verify that the application is installed and running by logging into the admin console of the development environment and launching the Applications tool.

You should now see something like this:

== Add a controller

Our first contribution to the app will be a simple "Hello App" controller. Create a new file called `src/main/resources/main.js` in your project.

[source,javascript]
----
include::main.js[]
----

Build and deploy your application once more.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew deploy
----

When looking at the application from admin console again, you should see a new section called "Web app" in the details panel. This will contain a link ala localhost://app/my.first.app. Click the link to launch your app.

You should now see something like this:
